# KickDesign

Welcome to my second Intensive Project!

For this project I've decided to create an image downloader for shoe designers!
This is a simple website that shoe designers can come to to download an outlined version of the shoe.

Why I chose this website:
Since I'm not that great at drawing, I ususally do my designs on an outlined version of the shoe
I want to customize. But I wanted a place where I can find all the different types of shoes in 
one place. 

My Website:

The homepage just consists of some tips on shoe cusotmization and why it's important to design it on paper
first. I then included some links that will help new users get started on their journey.
The shoes tab is where the user will find the blank shoe canvases and from there they will be able to download the image 
by clicking the button.

As I continue to improve on this project I want to create an in app shoe design studio where users can design it digitally and have the option 
to save their designs to a portfolio section where they can come back and improve or look at old designs.
